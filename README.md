**Simple Python Library Management System**

This is a simple library management system to help librarians manage their libraries by allowing them to enter book information into the system. The application will consist of two classes: Book and Library. The Book class will store details about each book such as author, title, and publication year, while the Library class will manage the collection and provide tools for adding, updating, and deleting books.
